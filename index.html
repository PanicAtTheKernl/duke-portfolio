    <h1>Hi, I'm Duke</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">I fix shit that other people break. Sometimes I break it first.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <strong>Fair warning:</strong> This isn't a polished corporate wank-fest. It's an actual portfolio by someone who's tired of pretending that modern web development isn't mostly bollocks.
    </div>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Duke. Some call me Kernl or PanicAtTheKernl, depending on which corner of the internet they found me screaming into the void. I've been fixing computers since before "full-stack developer" became code for "I copied some React tutorials and now I think I'm clever."</p>

    <p>I fix things that shouldn't be broken, build things that probably shouldn't exist, and break things just to see if I can put them back together better. Most of my best work happens between midnight and 4AM, fueled by spite, caffeine, and the burning desire to make PulseAudio work properly for once in its miserable existence.</p>

    <p>I believe good code should work without needing a bloody manual, websites should load faster than my patience runs out, and if your "revolutionary" startup idea requires 73 microservices to display a login form, you're part of the problem. Also, anyone who unironically uses "disruption" in a sentence deserves to have their laptop's thermal paste dry out.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Here's some stuff I've built, mostly out of anger at existing solutions:</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>System Recovery Toolkit</h3>
        <p>Born from pure rage after Windows Update killed my laptop for the third time in a month. Contains scripts that have saved more systems than Microsoft's own recovery tools ever will. Includes a bootable USB creator that actually fucking works and doesn't require 47 different ISO files.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Network Diagnostic Suite</h3>
        <p>Built after spending six hours on the phone with Sky support trying to explain that their router was utter shite. Features network scanning tools that don't lie to you about connection quality and a WiFi analyzer that tells you exactly which neighbour is hogging all the bandwidth with their smart doorbell.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>IP Scourge</h3>
        <p>A Python script that hunts down Minecraft servers with the dedication of a tax inspector. Started as a quick hack to find servers after my mate gave me directions like "it's the one with the thing, you know?" Now it's basically network reconnaissance that I definitely don't use for anything dodgy, officer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Felix North</h3>
        <p>An AI character with more personality than most startup founders and none of the buzzword vomit. Built because I was sick of chatbots that sound like they were trained exclusively on LinkedIn thought leadership posts and TED talks about "digital transformation."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Hardware Compatibility Checker</h3>
        <p>Exists because PC Part Picker isn't paranoid enough and I've watched too many people buy expensive paperweights. Includes a bullshit detector for marketing claims and real-world compatibility testing that actually matters. Will tell you if that RGB RAM is worth the extra £50 or if you're just paying for pretty lights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>ThinkPad Fan Curve Tool</h3>
        <p>Created at 3AM after my T480 decided to sound like a jet engine during a Zoom call. Gives you proper fan control instead of relying on Lenovo's "thermal management" which apparently means "cook the CPU until it throttles." Works better than the official software, obviously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Custom Debian Builds</h3>
        <p>For when you want Linux that doesn't come with 400 packages you'll never use. Stripped down, optimized, and configured by someone who actually gives a shit about boot times. Comes with working audio drivers because apparently that's too much to ask from most distros.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Performance Monitor That Actually Works</h3>
        <p>Built after getting fed up with system monitors that lie about CPU usage and memory consumption. This one tells you the truth, even when it hurts. Will ruthlessly call out which process is eating your RAM and why your SSD is crying.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>Here's what I actually use, not what looks good on a CV:</p>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Debian</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">Stable, boring, and doesn't surprise you with random bullshit updates. Like a reliable car that starts every morning.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Arch Linux (formerly)</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">Used it for years until I realized spending three hours fixing broken packages wasn't "learning," it was masochism.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Python</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">Quick and dirty, like most of my solutions. Slower than molasses but faster to write than my will to live.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Java</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">Corporate Stockholm syndrome. I hate it but it pays the bills and has more libraries than sense.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">C++</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">For when you want maximum performance and maximum suffering. Perfect for when Python is too slow and your sanity is optional.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Rust</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">Makes you feel like an idiot until you suddenly feel like a god. The borrow checker is basically pair programming with a really pedantic mate.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Docker</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">Containers for people who can't be arsed to set up proper deployment. Works everywhere, which is more than I can say for most things.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Vim</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">The only text editor that doesn't treat me like I'm five years old. VS Code users can keep their mouse, I'll keep my dignity.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tech-item">
        <div class="tech-name">Git</div>
        <div class="tech-opinion">Version control for people who make mistakes. So, everyone. Still better than SVN, which isn't saying much.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Brutal Truths</h2>
    <p>Things I believe that will probably get me blocked on LinkedIn:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript frameworks change faster than British weather and are about as predictable. Stop chasing the new shiny thing.</li>
        <li>If your website needs a loading spinner, you've already lost. This isn't 1998, and your users aren't that patient.</li>
        <li>Most "DevOps engineers" are just sysadmins who learned Docker commands and got better at marketing themselves.</li>
        <li>Microservices are what happens when you let architects who've never debugged a production system design your infrastructure.</li>
        <li>CSS frameworks are training wheels for people too lazy to learn actual CSS. Bootstrap isn't a personality trait.</li>
        <li>Agile is just waterfall with more meetings and Post-it notes. Your daily standups aren't making your code any less shit.</li>
        <li>If you need 200MB of node_modules to build a to-do app, you're doing it fucking wrong.</li>
        <li>The cloud is just someone else's computer, and they're probably worse at security than you are. Act accordingly.</li>
        <li>Unit tests that test fuck all are worse than no tests. Stop lying to yourself about code coverage.</li>
        <li>NoSQL databases are fine until you actually need to query your data. Then you're fucked.</li>
        <li>Anyone who says "premature optimization is the root of all evil" has never had to explain to users why their app runs like shit.</li>
        <li>Your React SPA doesn't need to exist. Most of your users would be happier with a static site and some basic JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Kubernetes is overkill for 90% of applications. You don't need to orchestrate three containers, you need therapy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <ul>

    <div class="footer">
        <!-- This website was built with contempt for modern web development -->
        Built with disdain for modern web design, a healthy disrespect for authority, and way too much caffeine.
        <br><br>
        <div class="easter-egg">
            If you made it this far, you're either procrastinating or you actually give a shit about web performance. Either way, respect.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 
        Congratulations, you've reached the end of this source code.
        You've just witnessed more optimization than most developers manage in their entire careers.
        
        No tracking scripts were murdered in the making of this website.
        No frameworks were bloated beyond recognition.
        No JavaScript was unnecessarily executed.
        No cookies were baked (digital or otherwise).
        No dark patterns were implemented.
        No A/B tests were conducted on your patience.
        
        This entire page is 8KB. Your average corporate website is 4MB.
        That's a 500x difference. Let that sink in while you wait for
        Medium to load its 73rd tracking script.
        
        P.S. - If you're a recruiter and you made it this far, you're either
        really desperate or you actually understand what good web development looks like.
        We should talk. Unless you're from a blockchain startup. Then fuck off.
        
        P.P.S. - If you're here to steal my CSS, knock yourself out. It's not like
        I invented black backgrounds and monospace fonts. But if you use it, at least
        give me credit for the attitude and the complete lack of JavaScript bullshit.
        
        P.P.P.S. - This comment block is longer than most people's entire JavaScript files.
        I'm not sorry. If anything, I'm proud that I can write more useful comments
        than most people can write useful code.
        
        P.P.P.P.S - If you work at Google, Facebook, or any other surveillance
        capitalism company and you're offended by this site, good. That was the point.
        Go back to your standing desk and your kombucha.
        
        P.P.P.P.P.S - Yes, I know there are five P.S. statements. No, I don't care.
        This is my website and I'll structure my closing comments however I bloody well please.
        My HTML validates and loads fast. Can you say the same about your React app?
        
        P.P.P.P.P.P.S - If you're using Internet Explorer to view this, I'm impressed
        it still works but also concerned about your life choices. Please seek help.
        
        P.P.P.P.P.P.P.S - Still here? Go build something useful instead of reading
        my rants. The world has enough broken websites already.
